or Lab05, I cloned the Beautiful Jekyll template into my own repo, set GitHub Pages to deploy from the master branch at the root, and customized _config.yml with a new site title and a navbar that adds Getting Started and Table Demo. I created getstarted.md and demonstrated scoped CSS by wrapping each of the three steps in unique <div> classes and styling them so the headers render red, blue, and green. I added a custom layout _layouts/liquid-table.html and a demo page table-demo.md that uses Liquid to populate a side-by-side comparison, then placed images in assets/img/ and referenced them with {{ site.baseurl }} so they load correctly. Finally, I cleaned up branches (making master the default), pushed all changes, and verified the live site and both new pages render as expected.
